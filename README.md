<h1>About the Project</h1>
<p>This project has a very interactive website which helps students to register for paid Yoga Classes in terms of monthly subscriptions in their chosen slots.</p>

<h1>How I built it:</h1>
<p>The frontend was made using HandleBars, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive UI.
The backend was developed in node.js and express.js. Using some middlewares like jwt, to generate tokens, cors to enable the external ports for the frontend.
I have used MongoDB Atlas as Database for storing different tyes of data like user details, payment details, and slot booking details.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>Use "npm run dev" to Run the application</p>
